This entertainment is suitable for those who do not have problems with the vestibular apparatus. If this is too extreme entertainment, then you can go down the boat from the cliff. Just be prepared to be wet from head to toe. The roller coaster is also worth a visit. At first, passengers will slowly float along the river and admire the scenery and watch the dinosaurs. And then they fall into a dark cave, and already at the exit, extreme descents and ascents await them.</p>
